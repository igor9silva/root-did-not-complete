# Import Management & Styling

## Import Management  
- **CRITICAL**: Add imports AFTER first usage to prevent prettier removal
- Import specific React hooks: `import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'`
- Never import entire React library unless necessary

## Tailwind Usage
- **NEVER** use hardcoded values like `min-w-[256px]`
- **ALWAYS** prefer Tailwind conventions: `min-w-64`
- Follow shadcn patterns for component styling

## Boolean Naming
- All booleans: `isSomething`, `hasSomething`, `shouldDoSomething` (yes/no question format)

## Ternary Operators
- Only use ternary when it fits on single line
- If its too big, find a better abstraction
	- Break large conditions into a variable
	- Break large JSX blocks into it's own component
	- Break large code blocks within JSX to it's own helper function
	- ...

## Component Organization
- **PascalCase** for component files (except for primitives within the ~/components/ui dir)
- Main component FIRST in file
- Helper components AFTER main component
- Prefer `array.concat()` over spread operator for performance
